# Machine Learning Project on Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery
# The Challenge:
Develop a predictive maintenance model for a fleet of industrial machines to anticipate failures before they occur. This project will involve analyzing sensor data from machinery to identify patterns that precede a failure. The goal is to create a classification model that can predict the type of failure (e.g., tool wear, heat dissipation, power failure) based on real-time operational data. This will enable proactive maintenance, reducing downtime and operational costs.
