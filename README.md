# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machines

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **predictive maintenance system** using machine learning techniques to prevent unexpected industrial machine failures. The system predicts different types of machine failures in advance, enabling proactive maintenance, reducing downtime, and lowering operational costs.

This was developed as a **Capstone Project** at **Swarrnim Startup and Innovation University** by **Parth Bhagyesh Dave** using IBM Watsonx AutoAI and IBM Cloud.

## ðŸš¨ Problem Statement
Industrial machinery failures often lead to unplanned downtimes and high maintenance costs. The aim of this project is to:

- Detect patterns in sensor data that indicate impending failures.
- Build a **multi-class classification model** to predict failure types:
  - Tool wear failure
  - Heat dissipation failure
  - Power failure
  - Random failure
  - Overstrain failure

# The Challenge:
Develop a predictive maintenance model for a fleet of industrial machines to anticipate failures before they occur. This project will involve analyzing sensor data from machinery to identify patterns that precede a failure. The goal is to create a classification model that can predict the type of failure (e.g., tool wear, heat dissipation, power failure) based on real-time operational data. This will enable proactive maintenance, reducing downtime and operational costs.
